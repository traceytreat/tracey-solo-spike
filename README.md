# solo project spike - tesseract
For this spike I tried using tesseract.js on a few images (located in public/images folder). It worked fine on some words, buggy on others. Super finicky overall. It was fun to play around with and figure out what makes a image easier/harder to read with OCR. I'll have to rethink adding it to my project since it seems to hate my handwriting--although iPhone's OCR seems to have no issue reading my handwriting, so it might just be a tesseract thing. I'll continue to check out other OCR libraries to see if there's another one that works better!

To run:
1. npm install
2. npm start

To change image:
1. add image to public/images folder
2. Change both of the urls in the TesseractDemo component.
