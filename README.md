# solo project spike - tesseract
For this spike I tried using tesseract.js on a few images (located in public/images folder). It worked fine on some words, buggy on others. Super finicky overall. It was fun to play around with and figure out what makes a image easier/harder to read with OCR. I'll have to rethink adding it to my project since it seems to hate my handwriting.

To run:
1. npm install
2. npm start
